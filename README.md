# The Hunter Deck

## Objective:
### - Create a website for users to store a collection of their hunters and weapons from Monster Hunter.
##
##
##
##
## Open app:
### Click [here](https://the-hunter-deck.herokuapp.com/) to go to the website.
##
##
## Motivation:
### Every Monster Hunter player needs a place to store their data from the franchises and this app is the place to do it! I wanted to create something where I can view my hutner at any time and add more data if need be.
